# Task Tracker CLI 🚀

## Overview

Task Tracker CLI is a high-performance, lightweight command-line utility built with **Node.js** for efficient task management. It provides a localized persistence layer using a JSON-based storage system, allowing developers to manage, track, and filter tasks without the overhead of a database server or a graphical interface.

## Features

- **Persistent Storage**: Utilizes a local `tasks.json` file for data integrity across sessions.
- **Dynamic ID Management**: Automatically handles unique identifier assignment for every new entry.
- **Status Lifecycle**: Supports transition between `todo`, `in-progress`, and `done` states.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Quickly list tasks based on their current status.
- **Validation**: Prevents duplicate task entries and ensures data consistency.
